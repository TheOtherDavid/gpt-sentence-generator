# language-stream

Language Stream is a program that will generate sample sentences to assist in language learning.
The current implementation displays the sentences on an Pimoroni Inky wHAT e-ink display, but with some minor modifications, you could display it on any other sort of screen, text message, e-mail, make your smart light bulbs blink it out in Morse Code, anything you can think of!
